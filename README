# In progress

-   Actions for a single arm at a time (in order)
-   Simple MCTS without graph search

# Observations

-   When training on samples derived from MCTS where we start the search from
    a-few-moves-from-the-end, the network very quickly overspecializes to spam
    "Drop"

# Future work

-   Train a timesteps-left head on existing solutions
-   Lean on existing solutions more, but be careful mixing them in with
    MCTS-generated solutions. They are from different domains; try having them
    train on non-overlapping outputs, to avoid the model overspecializing on
    "source"
-   Parallelise MCTS, batch NN evaluations
-   Make net/eval/training board size agnostic
-   use symmetries to generate more data
-   network/code for generating layouts
-   weight and neuron activation visualization
-   find/monitor dead neurons
-   better logging, saving intermediate layer outputs / residuals
-   keep more notes/observations for experiments, be more scientific about this
-   run same NN several times to get an idea of consistency
-   validation set in addition to training set

# idk

-   Does allowing action selection for any arm (rather than the next one in order)
    improve strength?
