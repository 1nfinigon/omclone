# omclone
A runner of Opus Magnum solutions with a UI that will help long tape solves.

Before compiling, you should rename "default_paths_SAMPLE.txt" to "default_paths.txt"
and edit the correct path to your Opus Magnum puzzle/solution folder into it.

Code is heavily influenced by omsim (https://github.com/ianh/omsim).


Enable only one of "editor_ui" or "display_ui" to get the corresponding app
If one of those is enabled, you can also enable "js_ui_mod" to make the app compile to wasm
then simply use "cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown"
You may want to change between opt-level "3" and "s" for executable vs. wasm respectively.
----
Enable feature "color-eye" for improved error reporting. Right now most errors hard crash.
Enable "benchmark" to get a program which will just run forever (useful for performance analysis)

You used to be able to enable "cx_checker" and compile with "wasm-pack build --target no-modules" to get the .wasm and .js in pkg folder. However, this functionality is currently broken.
