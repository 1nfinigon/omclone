# In progress

-   Actions for a single arm at a time (in order)
-   Simple MCTS without graph search

# Future work

-   Train a timesteps-left head on existing solutions
-   Lean on existing solutions more, but be careful mixing them in with
    MCTS-generated solutions. They are from different domains; try having them
    train on non-overlapping outputs, to avoid the model overspecializing on
    "source"
-   Parallelise MCTS, batch NN evaluations
-   Make net/eval/training board size agnostic

# idk

-   Does allowing action selection for any arm (rather than the next one in order)
    improve strength?
