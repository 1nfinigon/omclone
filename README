# omclone
A runner of Opus Magnum solutions with a UI that will help long tape solves.

Before compiling, you should rename "default_paths_SAMPLE.txt" to "default_paths.txt"
and edit the correct path to your Opus Magnum puzzle/solution folder into it.

Code is heavily influenced by omsim (https://github.com/ianh/omsim).

Enable feature "color-eye" for improved error reporting. Right now most errors hard crash.
Enable "benchmark" to get a program which will just run forever (useful for performance analysis)
